Alice in Wonderland
Review: This is my all time favorite movie, this movie is a spin-off of the orginal movie "Alice in Wonderland" from 1951. The main characters are Alice Kingsleigh and the mad hatter. Those two individuals really bring the movie together with their great acting skills. The movie starts with alice in her room asa kid with her crazy sister "the red queen" they go on a quest to gain back the thrown of the red queen.
